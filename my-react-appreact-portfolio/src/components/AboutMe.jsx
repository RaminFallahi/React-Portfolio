      <p>
        Call Me Rami :) I have a bachelor's degree in Industrial Design and a graduate degree in Web Development. I am also an AWS Cloud Practitioner certified professional. My background in design helps me approach projects with a unique perspective and ensures I provide user-centered solutions. I love being part of a team, and I always strive to learn from others, share my knowledge and improve my skills. Besides coding, I am an avid football fan and enjoy playing chess in my spare time. I am ambitious in my goals and believe that hard work and dedication can lead to endless opportunities.
